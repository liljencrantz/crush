Graphs:

Graphs consist of two data types: nodes and edges.

Crush nodes are simply rows in normal tables.

Crush edges are a new type that connect two table rows to each others. Every
edge contains two index references. Edges can be directed or undirected.
Edges can point to the same row or other rows in the same table, but allowing
them to point to rows in other tables would lead to reference cycles and memory
leaks. One-to-one relationships are simply edge fields. One-to-many, and many-to-many
relationships are modeled using fields of lists.

# Find leaf nodes
crush> ps | where { (children:len) == 0 }

A new operator, '::', is used to access a member in each element of a list.

# Find processes who are running as a different user than their parent
ps | where { parent::user != global:user:me:name }

When using '::' on a list/set of edges, it fetches that member in each element in returns them in a new list.

In order to display a graph as a tree, simply return an edge as the root object, and the pretty-printer will
do the rest:

crush> (ps | where {pid == 1}):parent
...


grpc command:

# Create new grpc instance:
crush> srv := (grpc "localhost:443")
# List all services on a server
crush> dir srv
[my.service other.service]
# List all methods of a service
crush> dir srv:my.service
[method1 method2]
# Call method without parameters
srv:my.service:method1
["some" "output"]
# Call method with parameters
srv:my.service:method2 id=1234 tags=(list:of "foo" "bar")
["other" "output"]

Validation:
All commands declare valid input and output types.
Input types can be partial, e.g. any iterator or any iterator with some restrictions.
Checks are performed to validate consistency.
Syntax for not having to duplicate output type.

Commands:
A simple command for replacing a regex in every line of a file. Implement it in crush, using built in commands.
Show permissions in the find command.
The find command could accept a glob or file as an optional parameter for filtering.
Extra columns for ps: memory usage, tty, current CPU usage.
du-like command for showing disk usage hierachy.
A grep-command.
chmod/chown equivalent
read equivalent
A drop command that is the opposite of select, i.e. it drops anu columns you mention and keeps the rest
Is it really a good idea to auto-run commands when they are passed in as named parameters? Might have gone overboard with eager evaluation there...
Allow simpler column renaming via select, e.g. 'ps|select time=^cpu'
html:from/to using html5ever under the hood
Add hex and base64 en/decoding methods to the binary/string types
Add utf-8 and other character encoding methods to the binary/string types
Maybe unset should be an operator, so that we don't have to quote the variable name, which feels inconsistent
Pretty printing option for text output formats
chmod method
open file commands, e.g. list all open fds, list sockets, list all fds of user, of process, etc.

Time to figure out tab completion.
This will eventually require a parser that can parse broken and incomplete input and return some kind of best guess.
