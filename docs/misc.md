# About Crush and other projects

## Similarity to PowerShell

Crush many of its surface level properties with PowerShell. I consider
PowerShell one of the coolest and most interesting innovations to ever come out
of Microsoft. That said, I've found using PowerShell in practice to often feel
clunky and annoying, especially for interactive use. I also feel that tying a
shell to COM objects is a poor fit.

I wanted to do something similar but with a more streamlined syntax, and with
what I felt was a more suitable type system.

## Similarity to Nushell

On the surface, Crush looks identical to nushell, but less polished. Crush has 
less polished syntax highlighting, tab completion and screen rendering. But that
is because the focus of Crush right now is to create a well defined, powerful
and convenient language that supports things like arithmetic operations,
closures, loops and flow control while remaining useful for interactive use.

### Future work

There are plenty of language ideas waiting to be tried out. Pattern matching and
error handling are among the most obvious. Also, the error handling in Crush
itself is currently very rudimentary.

## About the codebase

I am teaching myself rust by writing Crush. I still have plenty to learn. :-)
